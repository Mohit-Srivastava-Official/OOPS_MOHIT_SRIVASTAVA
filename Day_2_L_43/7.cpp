/*Inheritance in C++
 It allows us to create a new class (derived class/sub class) from an existing class (base class).



Modes of Inheritance



Public mode: If we derive a subclass from a public base class. Then, the base classâ€™s public members will become public in the derived class, and protected class members will become protected in the derived class.


Protected mode: If we derive a subclass from a Protected base class. Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class.


Private mode: If we derive a subclass from a Private base class. Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become Private in the derived class.
